Good times and bad times,
I gave you my everything
I tried and I tried to love you
through anything
Swore to each other
we'd never be enemies
Why the fuck would you say that to me?
Ain't nothing worse than somebody who
Lies to your face
and then swears it's the truth
If you have a heart,
rip it up, let it bleed
'Cause you said you would die for me
Said you would die for me
Said you would die for me
Don't leave me now
when I need you the most
Gave you my heart,
don't you dare let it go
Said you would die for me
Said you would die for me (Ooh)
Don't leave me now
when I need you the most
Said you would die for me
Said you'd never, never let me go
2 a.m., you ain't home
Called your friends,
said you're gone
I'm not gonna wait up here
But go ahead and stay out there
Oh-ooh, I'll sleep just fine
without you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't nothing worse than somebody who
Lies to your face
and then swears it's the truth
"I love you, I love you",
you said it loud
Those the three words you go
spitting out
You told me you love me,
where are you now?
(Where are you now?)
Said you would die for me
Said you would die for me (Ooh)
Don't leave me now,
when I need you the most
Gave you my heart,
don't you dare let it go
Said you would die for me
Said you would die for me (Ooh)
Don't leave me now
when I need you the most
Said you would die for me
Said you'd never, never let me go
Oh, die for me
Oh-oh-oh
Said you would die for me
Said you would die for me
Don't leave me now
when I need you the most
Said you would die for me
Said you'd never, never let me go
