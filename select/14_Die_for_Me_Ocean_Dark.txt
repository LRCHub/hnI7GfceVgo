The night has come
All around
Darkness falling
Weary eyes
Silent cries
Just the same old phrase

To lose it all
A chance to win
It makes no sense
Too fool to call
Any help at all
I carry my own shame

What I feel, seems so unreal
My mind is shattered and my head's still spinning
Free, I wanna be
If I give my life to you, would you die for me
Die for me
Die for me

The day has come
All around
People are searching
For a peace of mind
Answers that rhyme
With the purpose

What I feel, seems so unreal
My mind is shattered and my head's still spinning
Free, I wanna be
If I give my life to you, would you die for me
Die for me
Die for me

What I feel, seems so unreal
My mind is shattered and my head's still spinning
Free, I wanna be
If I give my life to you, would you die for me

I wanna feel
My mind is shattered and my head's still spinning
Free, I wanna be
If I give my life to you, would you die for me
Die for me
Die for me
