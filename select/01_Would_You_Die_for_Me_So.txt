I'll tell you my problem
I can't surrender
There's something on your mind
Telling me that I can't surrender

Plays his cards like a leading man
Passing his fears from hand to hand
Seems like everyone wants to be someone else
But I'm not sure I even like myself

You tell me my problem
I can't surrender
There's something on your mind
Telling me that I... I can't surrender

Would you... Die for me
There's a hole in my heart
But there's no surrender
Could you. Lie for me
This is where the danger lies
And there's no surrender

His boyish smile leaves you vulnerable
Perfecting his style frame by frame
Convinced that everyone needs someone else
There's something on your mind

Would you... Die for me
There's a hole in my heart
But there's no surrender
Could you. Lie for me
This is where the danger lies
But I can't surrender

Can't believe this is really happening to me

And I'm rolling on and on and on and on
There's something, there's something on your mind
